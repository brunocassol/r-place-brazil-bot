# Brazil's bot in /r/place

![Final image](final_r_place.png?raw=true "Final image")

This was developed in a rush during a weekend while evading Reddit devs and helping coordinating a campaign on https://www.reddit.com/r/place/. Don't judge me.

It downloads this image automatically and draws it:

![Template](image_rendered.png?raw=true "Template")

# How to use
**Note**: Reddit's event is over. This no longer works.

Press F12 on Chrome and paste this on console:

$.getScript("https://rawgit.com/brunocassol/r-place-brazil-bot/master/bot.js")

# Bonus
`converter.html` is an image to template converter. It converts images to javascript template format.

It also demonstrates how the bot encrypts coordinates inside an image. `test.png` is represent X,Y coordinates encoded in a PNG.
